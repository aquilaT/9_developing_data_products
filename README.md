## APP DESCRIPTION AND KEY FUNCTIONALITY

My Shiny Application is using various inputs to simulating Standard Normal distribution charts with custom parameters. 

This Shiny Web application was developed for those students who study Statistics. Visualization of how different statistical distribution functions will change should help students to better visualize and memorize:

1. how major statistical charts (PDF, CDF, Random draws from Standard Normal) look like under different parameters
2. how these charts will change if we change major parameters: Mean, Standard 
3. availability of 3 sets of charts on 1 plot allows for better comparison and understanding

Live and interactive visualization of inputs and outputs is an excellent way to deeper learn, "sense" and understand the concept of NORMAL GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION CHARTS. 

## RUNNING SIMULATIONS

This App can generate 3 sets of major Normal distribution's curves based on independantly set 6 parameters so that we could observe and better understand various combinations. 

INPUTS:

- for each of 3 curves you need to select 2 variable parameters: STANDARD DEVIATION and MEAN
- ST DEVIATION varies in the range of 1....5 (default values are 1,2,3 for each of 3 curves)
- MEAN can vary in the range -10....+10 (default values is 0 for each of 3 curves)

FIRST CURVE: Set MEAN1 and STANDARD DEVIATION1 using Slidebars 1 and 2

SECOND CURVE: Set MEAN2 and STANDARD DEVIATION2 using Slidebars 3 and 4

THIRD CURVE: Set MEAN3 and STANDARD DEVIATION3 using Slidebars 5 and 6

By changing each of 6 parameters now, we can observe how Normal Disttribution charts change live.
